          <h2>Documentation</h2>

          <p>I used good CRAP techniques, making sure every page was aligned well and had a well designed flow</p>
          <p>I chunked the content, mostly into cards for the restaurants and the schools, as well as some pages with paragraphs of info</p>
          <p>My content shows the best parts of West Hartford in a clear and concise manner, with spelling and grammar accounted for.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>I have 10 content pages, with some of the home pages also acting as content pages for this 10, as they hold additional info about their section</p>
          <p>All of my code is properly indented and is well thought out.</p>
          <p>My site is easy to get around with the hamburger menu that acts as the global nav for the website</p>
          <p>My HTML validates and so does my css</p>
          <p>This page is linked from my homepage</p>
          <p>Finally, my website is responsive for all devices</p>
