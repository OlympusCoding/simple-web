            <h2>West Hartford: A Brief History</h2>

            <h4>Native Presence:</h4>

            <p>Before Europeans arrived in West Hartford, the areas around the Connecticut River were used as winter camps by
                the Wampanoag Tribe. The river provided fish and the surrounding
                areas were good hunting grounds. The region also provided solace from the cold winters, as
                well as the spring flooding of the CT River.
            </p>

                        again to no avail.
